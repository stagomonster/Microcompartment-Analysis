function carboxysome_data = chain_maker(filename, carboxysome_data, min_chain_length)
% this is the function following linkage formation in the pipeline. it
% takes all viable linkages and uses a data structure called a disjoint set
% to find all rubiscos that are connected to one another, which are defined
% to be rubisco chains. the min_chain_length variable represents the
% minimum length required for a set of linked rubiscos to be considered a
% chain and is set to a default of 3. After rubiscos are grouped into
% chains, they are put in order in the chains. Which rubiscos are above and
% below them are stored in the rubisco object. Consecutive rubiscos without
% a linkage will return an error and will skip above/below designation for
% the chain. These are likely bad data, so the particles with the 
% lowest cc involved in each error are deleted from the dataset. The 
% original input table is unaltered, but a new table with bad particles 
% deleted is created in the working directory.
%
% Inputs
% filename - the name of data file to be read if pre-computed 
%            carboxysome_data is not provided.
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects already containing
%                    computed data and pairs from linkages.m.
% min_chain_length - the minimum length of linked rubiscos to be considered
%                    a chain
%
% Outputs
