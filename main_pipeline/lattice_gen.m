function carboxysome_data = lattice_gen(filename, carboxysome_data, threshold)
% This function takes in the chain linkages and turns them into viable 
% lattices based on the same principles as the chain_maker (using a 
% disjoint set object). Sets whose sizes clear the threshold are called a
% lattice. Each carboxysome is assigned a lattice type and the chains which
% make up the lattice are stored in the carboxysome object.
%
% Inputs
% filename - the name of the file the data originates from. If the only
%            input is filename then it will run every script in the main 
%            pipeline up to here automatically
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects filled with rubisco
%                    data
% threshold - the minimum number of chains that must be connected to form a
%             lattice, defaults to 5
%
% Outputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects with the linkages and
%                    max_connections properties populated
