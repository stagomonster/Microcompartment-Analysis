function carboxysome_data = linkages(filename, carboxysome_data, min_distance_factor, max_distance_factor, radius_factor, max_angle, mutual)
% Compute the linkages between rubisco in each carboxysome. We define a
% linkage as a valid Pair of Rubisco. All possible pairs are created
% beforehand by local_global_alignment, and this script will filter
% through them to select only valid bindings. There are 3 (optionally
% 4) filters. To create a linkage, target rubiscos must be within a
% cylindrical space at one end of the source rubisco and aligned with 
% the vector of the source rubisco. We define that cylindrical space 
% with "distance" (the height of the cylinder), "angle" (the angle 
% between the orientation vectors of the rubiscos), and "radius" (the
% target rubisco's distance from the axis of the source rubisco). The
% optional 4th parameter, "mutual" requires that all 3 filters be
% passed in both directions, that is, it doesn't matter which rubisco
% is the "source" and which is the "target", they both see the other as
% a linkage. This script is not built to handle cases where multiple
% rubiscos fit into the same cylinder. For this reason we recommend
% using the helper function calc_cylinder_radius.m to calculate what
% maximum radius_factor you should use with this program to prevent
% multiple particles in the same cylinder.
%
% Inputs
% filename - the name of data file to be read if pre-computed 
%            carboxysome_data is not provided.
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects already containing
%                    computed data and pairs from 
%                    local_global_alignment.m. 
% min_distance_factor - a multiple of the rubisco diameter to search 
%                       along the source rubisco axis, so if 
%                       min_distance_factor = 1.3, then the bottom of
%                       the search cylinder will be 1.3 rubisco
%                       diameters from the center of the source rubisco
% max_distance_factor - a multiple of the rubisco diameter to search 
%                       along the source rubisco axis, so if 
%                       max_distance_factor = 1.3, then the top of
%                       the search cylinder will be 1.3 rubisco
%                       diameters from the center of the source rubisco
% radius_factor - the multiple of the rubisco diameter to search 
%                 outward from the axis. If radius_factor = 0.7 then 
%                 the search cylinder will have a radius of 0.7 rubisco
%                 diameters
% max_angle - the maximum allowable angle between the rubiscos in a
%             linkage in degrees.
% mutual - a boolean that requires the linkages to reference one 
%          another if it is true (encouraged if radius_factor is larger
%          than 0.45).
%
% Outputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects with rubisco linkages
%                    populated
