function [] = neighboring_rubisco_bend_analysis(carboxysome_data, bin_limit, bin_width, min_chain_length)
% This function creates a histogram of the bend angles between adjacent 
% rubiscos in a chain and colors the data based on the inner concentration
% of the chain's parent carboxysome. The user can select the range of the 
% histogram bins, width of the bins, and the minimum chain length.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of carboxysome objects filled with data at
%                    least through chain_maker.m
% bin_limit - the rightmost bin edge value, recommended to be the value
%             used for max_angle in chain_maker (tight - 25, pivot - 50)
% bin_width - the width to make bins in the histogram (in degrees)
% min_chain_length - the minimum length a chain can be and still be
%                    included in this analysis
