function link_arc_analysis(carboxysome_data, label, pointSize, max_angle)
% This function generates a scatter plot of the positions of target rubisco
% relative to source rubisco. On the y-axis is the distance between the 
% rubisco centers along the direction of the symmetry axis of the source 
% rubisco. On the x-axis is the distance between the rubisco centers 
% perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the source rubisco. Both distances 
% are represented as a multiple of the rubisco diameter. The color of each
% point on the plot represents the angle between the axes of symmetry of
% the two rubisco. Then the function plots the x data and y data as 
% histograms on separate figures. The data can be filtered before plotting
% the histograms for clarity. The user can specify a label to be included 
% in the scatter plot title, the size of the points on the scatter plot, 
% and the maximum angle between rubisco that are still plotted.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects already containing
%                    computed data and pairs from local_global_alignment.m.
% label - a string to be printed in the title of the figure
% pointSize - the size of the data points in the figure (default is 2)
% max_angle - the maximum angle between the symmetry axes of rubisco to
%             allow to be plotted
