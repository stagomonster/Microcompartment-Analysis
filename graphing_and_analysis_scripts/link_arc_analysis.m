function link_arc_analysis(carboxysome_data, label, pointSize, max_angle)
% This function generates a scatter plot of the positions of target rubisco
% relative to source rubisco. On the x-axis is the distance between the
% rubisco centers perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the source rubisco.
% On the y-axis is the distance between the rubisco centers along the
% direction of the symmetry axis of the source rubisco. Both distances are
% represented as a multiple of the rubisco diameter. The color of each
% point on the plot represents the angle between the axes of symmetry of
% the two rubisco. The user can specify a label to be included in the
% figure title, the size of the points on the plot, and the maximum angle
% between rubisco that are still plotted.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of Carboxysome objects already containing
%                    computed data and pairs from local_global_alignment.m.
% label - a string to be printed in the title of the figure
% pointSize - the size of the data points in the figure (default is 2)
% max_angle - the maximum angle between the symmetry axes of rubisco to
%             allow to be plotted
