function [] = chain_lengths_analysis(carboxysome_data, min_chain_length, min_linkages)
% This function plots a histogram of chain lengths present in the dataset.
% It allows you to filter out shorter chains by setting a minimum chain
% length that a chain must meet to be plotted. It also allows you to filter
% out chains that aren't in lattices by setting a minimum number of
% linkages the chain must participate in to be plotted. The data points are
% colored according to the total rubisco concentration of their parent
% carboxysomes.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of carboxysome objects filled with data at
%                    least through chain_maker.m
% min_chain_length - the minimum length of a chain that should still be
%                    included in this analysis
% min_linkages - the minimum number of linkages a chain must have to other
%                chains to be included in this analysis. Set this to zero 
%                if you want every chain in the dataset. Carboxysome
%                objects must be filled with data through at least
%                chain_linkages.m to use this filter with any value other
%                than zero.
