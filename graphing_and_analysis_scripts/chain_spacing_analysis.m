function [] = chain_spacing_analysis(carboxysome_data, min_chain_length, max_distance, bin_width)
% This function creates two plots regarding the spatial relationships 
% between chains. First, it makes a histogram of the angles between 
% neighboring chains. The user can select the width of the histogram bins, 
% the maximum distance between neighbors, and the minimum chain length.
% Second, it makes a normal Kernel probability density function 
% (bandwidth=0.5) of the distances between chains. The user can select the 
% minimum chain length. Both plots'data are colored based on the inner 
% concentration of the chains' parent carboxysome.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of carboxysome objects filled with data at
%                    least through chain_maker.m
% min_chain_length - the minimum length a chain can be and still be
%                    included in this analysis
% max_distance - the maximum distance (in nanometers) between two chains 
%                that can still be neighbors
% bin_width - the width to make bins in the histogram (in degrees)
