function [] = visualize_carboxysome_3d(filename)
% This function conveniently helps the user run the Visualize Carboxysome
% 3D javascript. First it ensures the user has a .tbl file in the directory
% Visualize_Carboxysome_3D/files for them to visualize. If the input
% filename does not exist in that folder, it is written there. Then it runs
% the npx vite command and tells the user to open the webpage using one of
% two methods. First, they can copy and paste the url next to "Local:".
% Second, they could press the "o" key and then "enter". When finished the
% user should press "q" and then "enter".
%
% Inputs:
% filename - the path to the file that should make the carboxysome
%            visualization. Must be a .tbl file.
